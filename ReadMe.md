# Exploration of Big data and Machine learning methods. 
Primarily focus on dimension reduction and clustering. Performance comparison for different clustering methods for different type of data and performance with respect to identify different amount of clusters in the data.


# Installation
Create a virual enviroment, activate it and install its requirements. 
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run code

``` 
python3 main.py
```

# Results

See generated plots and note that different inputs for the data simulation can generate vastly different results, i.e different methods are prefered for different inputs.
